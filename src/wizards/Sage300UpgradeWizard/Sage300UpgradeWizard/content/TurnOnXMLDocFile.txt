The generate XML documentation file property determines whether an XML
file will be generated during compilation. When this option is selected,
XML documentation is automatically emitted into an XML file, which will 
have the same name as your project and the .xml extension.

When turn on this property, all the public class, methods, properties, 
constants, enums should have proper XML documentation comments, otherwise
it will have warnings or errors when compile project or solution.

You can optional turn on it when upgrade to Sage 300 2018.0 or manually 
turn on later in the project property build table.
