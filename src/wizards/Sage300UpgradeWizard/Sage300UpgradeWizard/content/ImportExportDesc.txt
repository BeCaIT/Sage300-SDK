Sage 300 2018.0 Framework adds Import/Export common component for web application.

For implementing import/export functionality, it should override some 
import/export base class and supply BusinessEnityProperty or a hierarchy 
of BusinessEnityProperty which represents the header/detail kind of 
composition in Accpac business wiews.  

Details see Sage 300 Import/Export documentation and sample code 
for import/export.
