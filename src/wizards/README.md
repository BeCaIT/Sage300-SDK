## Grid Enhancement

The solution wizard has been modified to include the **Grid Enhancement** files, which are 
a late addition to the Sage 300 application (post code complete).

If generated code by the Code Generation Wizard will utilize the grid enhancement classes, please 
refer to the patch instructions in the README file of the **patch** folder.

The code files included in the patch will be included in the Sage 300 2017.1 code base and 
therefore the patch will not be required for release 2017.1
