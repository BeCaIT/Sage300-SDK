## Generating JavaScript for Grids

The Grid Enhancement logic that has been included in the samples projects has dramatically changed
the JavaScript requirements of a grid implementation. The documentation for the Generating JavaScript 
for Grids utility does not reflect these changes nor does the Generating JavaScript for Grids utility
itself. However, it is still valid for generating JavaScript which does not use the enhancemnet logic.
